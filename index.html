                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I am studying IT Architecture at <a href="http://kea.dk">Copenhagen School of Design and Technology</a>, where I have developed a strong passion for working with technology and people.
                    I find it exciting and rewarding to collaborate with both colleagues and clients, and I thrive in environments where innovation and teamwork are prioritized.
                    I can work independently as well as in teams, and I am always willing to give a helping hand.
                    I welcome new ideas and challenges with open arms, as I love to think creatively and view tasks from different perspectives.
                </p>
